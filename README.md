The Health of Women and Girls Determines the Health and Well-Being of Our Modern World:
This report says about the health and care of the women and girls in a remote area of the countries. As per the survey from 2005 and 2015, the system is failing to provide proper health and care schemes to the women and girls in the remote areas.
Women and girls have specific health needs, and health systems around the world are failing them (World Health Organization [WHO], 2009). The WHO states that today women’s health has become an urgent priority, yet the data surrounding this issue are limited and often unreliable (WHO, 2009). It is ICOWHI’s aim to improve the health, health, care and well-being of women worldwide.
The WHO estimates that women remain at a disadvantage in securing paid jobs, however, due to pervading sociocultural attitudes, minimal options for balancing work and family responsibilities, and challenges in birth control.
